Discord bot to see if minecraft server is online.

The visual functionality is taken from [Cactooz's MinecraftServer-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cactooz/MinecraftServer-DiscordBot), which itself is a fork of [Vegeta897's simple Minecraft server status bot](https://gist.github.com/vegeta897/e4410669c921c2ab7635e1d0153b0bc6). I just fit it ot my needs.
